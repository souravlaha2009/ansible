The topology we're using is a common three tier web application architecture.

We have a load balancer tear along with the application tier and database here.

In addition in addition to these three tiers we have a control machine that sits off to the side

and the control machine really acts as the orchestration of the place that we're going to install and

spool and do all of our mission management throughout this course.

Ansible Installation
----------------------
Assumption:
1) The first assumption is that you have access to a control machine recone install installations.
2) The second assumption I'm making about the full environment is that all of the end servers are going
to be running a ubuntu trustee and that is a very common Linux distribution.
3) Third assumption is that all commands are going to be run from the control machine.
4) Fourth assumption is that the control machine has ssh access already set up so all the other hosts.
5) And the last assumption I'm making is that the user that you set up to use to have X ansible run as
will have super user access on your posts.So this is not a strict requirement to actually run ansible and still can run without super user access.

sudo easy_install pip
sudo pip install ansible

ansible --version
ansible-playbook --version
ansible-galaxy --version

Lab 1 : Delete all the peconfigured target hosts

ansible --list-hosts all
sudo vi /etc/ansible/hosts
delete all the hosts
ansible --list-hosts all


docker run --name lb01 -d -p 8080:80 nginx
docker run --name app01 -d -p 9990:9990 jboss/wildfly-admin
docker run --name app02 -d -p 8081:80 my-apache
docker run --name db01 -d -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysql mysql

Password Less Access
=====================
1) Generate the SSH Keys
ssh-keygen -t rsa

2) Make a .ssh directory on the destination Machine
ssh -i "MyLinuxKPHome.pem" ec2-user@ec2-13-126-82-177.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com mkdir -p .ssh

3) Copy the public key to the destination Machine
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh -i "MyLinuxKPHome.pem" ec2-user@ec2-13-126-82-177.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'

4) Change the permissions of the .ssh directory and authorized_keys
ssh -i "MyLinuxKPHome.pem" ec2-user@ec2-13-126-82-177.ap-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com "chmod 700 .ssh; chmod 640 .ssh/authorized_keys"


1) Generate the SSH Keys
ssh-keygen -t rsa

2) Make a .ssh directory on the destination Machine
ssh -i "MyLinuxKPHome.pem" ec2-user@13.233.20.154 mkdir -p .ssh

3) Copy the public key to the destination Machine
cat .ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh -i "MyLinuxKPHome.pem" ec2-user@13.233.20.154 'cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'

4) Change the permissions of the .ssh directory and authorized_keys
ssh -i "MyLinuxKPHome.pem" ec2-user@13.233.20.154 "chmod 700 .ssh; chmod 640 .ssh/authorized_keys"

Lab 2: Create our own inventory file

Create a file dev-hosts
vi dev-hosts
[loadbalancer]
lb01

[webserver]
app01
app02

[database]
db01

[control]
control ansible_connection=local

Test Command
ansible - i dev-hosts --list-hosts all

Lab 3: Create our own ansible configuration file
vi ansible.cfg
[defaults]
inventory = ./dev-hosts

Test Command
ansible --list-hosts all


Lab 4: Host Selection with Patterns
https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_patterns.html

ansible --list-hosts "*"
ansible --list-hosts loadbalancer
ansible --list-hosts webserver
ansible --list-hosts db01
ansible --list-hosts ap*
ansible --list-hosts database:control
ansible --list-hosts webserver[0]
ansible --list-hosts \!control

Lab 5: Ping all the modules
ansible -m ping all
